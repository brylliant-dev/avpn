        "Story_Description": "In 2023, AVPN and Takeda Pharmaceuticals partnered to address Asia's broadening dengue spread, focusing on climate change’s health impact, vaccine equity, and expanding access to healthcare. Through coordinated efforts in Indonesia, Thailand, and India, AVPN convened stakeholders to address the dengue crisis. Inspired by these efforts, BBC Storyworks, along with the WHO Foundation, supported the creation of a mini-documentary showcasing dengue’s human impact in Balikpapan, Indonesia, highlighting the need for urgent public health solutions. Featured at global forums like the World Health Assembly, this initiative amplified the dialogue on dengue prevention and underscored the importance of preventative solutions including vaccination. AVPN’s ability to bring together diverse partners, combined with Takeda’s healthcare leadership, exemplified the power of collective action, and reinforced both organisations’  commitment to building resilient, equitable health systems across Asia.",
